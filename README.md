# daily-streak

Idea for an app -- v. early brainstorming stage

Simple interface inspired by Duolingo's flame with a number inside that counts how many days in a row you have completed a lesson. Basically do that only with anything you want to make a habit, push notification (customize the time) asks if you've done it, and when you say "yes" I completed it, it gives you a backdrop of fire with your number of days in a row. Other options could be fireworks-- (a firework for each day? But has to kill the loop count when you close the app so you don't have to watch the whole thing), waterfall, waves, customizable???

Questions:
Does it need databases? One for each (potential) user?
